# Who has used Heroin? An Application of Machine Learning in Drug Use Prediction

## Introduction
In this project we look to answer the question: is it possible to distinguish between people who have
used Heroin vs people who have never used?
We use various sklearn binary classifiers and cross validation to find the best model.

## Results
Tested models include: Categorical Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGBoost and Random Forest.
Random Forest performed best with the highest mean cv accuray and lowest cv standard error.
Using Random Forest we were able to acheive an accuracy of 85%.
